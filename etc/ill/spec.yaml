# INTRODUCTION:
#
# This file creates a data structures defining what fields of the XML
# responses from the ILL API we want to use, and how we use them.  The
# API currently developed against is the British Library's DSS
# Interlibrary Loan API.
#
# The 'record' data structure is concerned with defining the way we
# want to handle bibliographic and item information resulting from API
# searches.
#
# The 'availability' data structure has similar concerns, but for
# availability information regarding a specific 'record'.
#
# The 'prices' data structure is concerned with responses providing
# pricing information for the API's services.

# SEMANTICS:
#
# The semantics of our abstract representation are as follows:
# - The top level identifies the response type (e.g. 'record').
# - Each element or attribute we want to refer to in the API's
#   response should be a key at the next level of indentation.
#
# Keywords (markup):
#   + name: a human readable value for the field. This is used, for
#     instance, for rendering the field's value on webpages. Any
#     fields that have a 'name' keyword are returned as part of the
#     'getFullDetails' method of ILL Records.
#
#   + inSummary: if used for a field, then this field will be one of
#     the fields returned by the 'getSummary' method of ILL Records.
#
#   + accessor: if defined, this is the id that can be used in the
#     'getProperty' method of ILL Records.
#
#   + many: use many to indicate that the element in question is one
#     that recurs.  E.g. if the xml response provides an "isbns"
#     element which may contain any number of "isbn" elements, then
#     the "isbn" element in the spec here should use the many keyword.
#
# Remember: to simply not work with given fields returned by the API's
# response it suffices to not define those fields in the abstract
# representation at all.
#
# Attributes vs. Elements:
#
# You can specify an attribute you wish to retrieve by prepending its
# id with an "@" symbol, like in xpath.  In order for this to be valid
# YAML, you'll need to enclose the id in quotation marks, e.g. "@key".
