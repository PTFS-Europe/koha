=head1 NAME

delete_patrons - This script deletes patrons

=head1 SYNOPSIS

delete_patrons.pl [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-c|--confirm] [--not_borrowed_since=DATE] [--expired_before=DATE] [--last-seen=DATE] [--category_code=CAT] [--category_code=CAT ...] [--library=LIBRARY] [--file=FILE]

Dates should be in ISO format, e.g., 2013-07-19, and can be generated
with `date -d '-3 month' --iso-8601`.

The options to select the patron records to delete are cumulative.  For
example, supplying both --expired_before and --library specifies that
that patron records must meet both conditions to be selected for deletion.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h|--help>

Print a brief help message

=item B<--not_borrowed_since>

Delete patrons who have not borrowed since this date.

NOTE: Patrons who have all their old checkouts anonymized will
have an empty circulation history and be deleted if this option is
used. Anonymization can happen because the patron has
borrowers.privacy = 2, through cronjobs doing anonymization
or by the patron choosing to anonymize their history in the
OPAC.

=item B<--expired_before>

Delete patrons with an account expired before this date.

=item B<--last_seen>

Delete patrons who have not been active since this date.

The system preference TrackLastPatronActivityTriggers must contain at least one trigger to use this option.

=item B<--category_code>

Delete patrons who have this category code.

Can be used multiple times for additional category codes.

=item B<--library>

Delete patrons in this library.

=item B<--file>

Delete patrons whose borrower numbers are in this file.  If other criteria are defined
it will only delete those in the file that match those criteria.

=item B<-c|--confirm>

This flag must be provided in order for the script to actually
delete patron records.  If it is not supplied, the script will
only report on the patron records it would have deleted.

=item B<-v|--verbose>

Verbose mode.
