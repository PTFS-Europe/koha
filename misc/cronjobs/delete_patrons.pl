=head1 NAME

delete_patrons - This script deletes patrons

=head1 SYNOPSIS

delete_patrons.pl [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-c|--confirm] [--not_borrowed_since=DATE] [--expired_before=DATE] [--last-seen=DATE] [--category_code=CAT] [--library=LIBRARY]

Dates should be in ISO format, e.g., 2013-07-19, and can be generated
with `date -d '-3 month' "+%Y-%m-%d"`.

The options to select the patron records to delete are cumulative.  For
example, supplying both --expired_before and --library specifies that
that patron records must meet both conditions to be selected for deletion.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

Delete patrons who have not borrowed since this date.

=item B<--expired_before>

=item B<--category_code>
