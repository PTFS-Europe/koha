stockrotation.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    --[a]dmin-email    An address to which email reports should also be sent
    --[b]ranchcode     Select branch to report on for 'email' reports (default: all)
    --e[x]ecute        Actually perform stockrotation housekeeping
    --[r]eport         Select either 'full' or 'email'
    --[S]end-all       Send email reports even if the report body is empty
    --[s]end-email     Send reports by email
    --[h]elp           Display this help message

Cron script implementing scheduled stockrotation functionality.

By default this script merely reports on the current status of the
stockrotation subsystem.  In order to actually place items in transit, the
script must be run with the `execute` argument.

`report` allows you to select the type of report that will be emitted. It's
set to 'full' by default.  If the `email` report is selected, you can use the
`branchcode` parameter to specify which branch's report you would like to see.
The default is 'all'.

`admin-email` is an additional email address to which we will send all email
reports in addition to sending them to branch email addresses.

`send-email` will cause the script to send reports by email, and `send-all`
will cause even reports with an empty body to be sent.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is used to move items from one stockrotationstage to the next,
if they are elible for processing.

it should be run from cron like:

   stockrotation.pl --report email --send-email --execute

Prior to that you can run the script from the command line without the
--execute and --send-email parameters to see what reports the script would
generate in 'production' mode.  This is immensely useful for testing, or for
getting to understand how the stockrotation module works: you can set up
different scenarios, and then "query" the system on what it would do.

Normally you would want to run this script once per day, probably around
midnight-ish to move any stockrotationitems along their rotas and to generate
the email reports for branch libraries.

Each library will receive a report with "items of interest" for them for
today's rota checks.  Each item there will be an item that should, according
to Koha, be located on the shelves of that branch, and which should be picked
up and checked in.  The item will either:
- have been placed in transit to their new stage library;
- have been placed in transit to be returned to their current stage library;
- have just been added to a rota and will already be at the correct library;

In the last case the item will be checked in and no message will pop up.  In
the other cases a message will pop up requesting the item be posted to their
new branch.

=head2 What does the --execute flag do?

To understand this, you will need to know a little bit about the design of
this script and the stockrotation modules.

This script operates in 3 phases: first it walks the graph of rotas, stages
and items.  For each active rota, it investigates the items in each stage and
determines whether action is required.  It does not perform any actions, it
just "sieves" all items on active rotas into "actionable" and "non-actionable"
baskets.  We can use these baskets to perform actions against the items, or to
generate reports.

During the second phase this script then loops through the actionable baskets,
and performs the relevant action (initiate, repatriate, advance) on each item.

Finally, during the third phase we revisit the original baskets and we compile
reports (for instance per branch email reports).

When the script is run without the "--execute" flag, we perform phase 1, skip
phase 2 and move straight onto phase 3.

With the "--execute" flag we also perform the database operations.

So with or without the flag, the report will look the same (except for the "No
database updates have been performed.").
