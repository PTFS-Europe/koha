=head1 NAME

cancel_unfilled_holds.pl - script to delete unfilled holds after a given
number of days.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 cancel_unfilled_holds.pl [--days][--library][--holidays][--confirm][--verbose][--reason]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help | -h>

Print brief help and exit.

=item B<--days>

Specify the number of days waiting since a hold that remains unfilled was placed.
E.g. a value of 730 would cancel holds placed 2 years ago or more that have never been filled

=item B<--library>

Repeatable option to specify which branchcode(s) to cancel holds for.

=item B<--holidays>

This switch specifies whether to count holidays as days waiting. Default is no.

=item B<--confirm>

Without this option, the script will run in test mode, and only report what it
would have done if it were not running in test mode.

=item B<--verbose | -v>

More verbose output.

=item B<--reason>

Optionally adds a reason for cancellation (which will trigger a notice to be sent to the patron)
