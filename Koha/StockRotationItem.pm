=head3 _type

=cut

sub _type {

}

=head3 item

  my $item = Koha::StockRotationItem->item;

Returns the item associated with the current stock rotation item.

Return 1 if this item is currently not at the library it should be at
according to our stockrotation plan.

}

=head3 needs_advancing

  1|0 = $item->needs_advancing;

Return 1 if this item is ready to be moved on to the next stage in its rota.

}

=head3 repatriate

  1|0 = $sritem->repatriate

Put this item into branch transfer with 'StockrotationRepatriation' comment, so
that it may return to it's stage.branch to continue its rota as normal.

Note: Stockrotation falls outside of the normal branch transfer limits and so we
pass 'ignore_limits' in the call to request_transfer.

    my ( $self, $msg ) = @_;

    # Create the transfer.

                ignore_limits => 1
            }

    # Ensure the homebranch is still in sync with the rota stage
    $self->item->homebranch( $self->stage->branchcode_id )->store;

    return defined($transfer) ? 1 : 0;
}

=head3 advance

  1|0 = $sritem->advance;

Put this item into branch transfer with 'StockrotationAdvance' comment, to
transfer it to the next stage in its rota.

If this is the last stage in the rota and this rota is cyclical, we return to
the first stage.  If it is not cyclical, then we delete this
StockRotationItem.

If this item is 'indemand', and advance is invoked, we disable 'indemand' and
advance the item as per usual.

Note: Stockrotation falls outside of the normal branch transfer limits and so we
pass 'ignore_limits' in the call to request_transfer.

=head3 toggle_indemand

Toggle this items in_demand status.

If the item is in the process of being advanced to the next stage then we cancel
the transfer, revert the advancement and reset the 'StockrotationAdvance' counter,
as though 'in_demand' had been set prior to the call to advance, by updating the
in progress transfer.
