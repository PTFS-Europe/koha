=head1 NAME

Koha::CookieManager - Object for unified handling of cookies in Koha

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Koha::CookieManager;
    my $mgr = Koha::CookieManager->new;

    # Replace cookies
    $cookie_list = $mgr->replace_in_list( [ $cookie1, $cookie2_old ], $cookie2_new );

    # Clear cookies (governed by deny list entries in koha-conf)
    $cookie_list = $mgr->clear_unless( $cookie1, $cookie2, $cookie3_name );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The current object allows you to clear cookies in a list based on the deny list
in koha-conf.xml. It also offers a method to replace the old version of a cookie
by a new one.

It could be extended by (gradually) routing cookie creation through it in order
to consistently fill cookie parameters like httponly, secure and samesite flag,
etc. And could serve to register all our cookies in a central location.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $mgr = Koha::CookieManager->new({}); # parameters for extensions

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, $params ) = @_;
    my $self = bless $params//{}, $class;
    my $denied = C4::Context->config(DENY_LIST_VAR) || []; # expecting scalar or arrayref
    $denied = [ $denied ] if ref($denied) eq q{};
    $self->{_remove_unless} = { map { $_ => 1 } @$denied };
    $self->{_secure} = C4::Context->https_enabled;
    return $self;
}

=head2 clear_unless

    $cookies = $self->clear_unless( $query->cookie, @$cookies );

    Arguments: either cookie names or cookie objects (CGI::Cookie).
    Note: in the example above $query->cookie is a list of cookie names as returned
    by the CGI object.

    Returns an arrayref of cookie objects: empty, expired cookies for those passed
    by name or objects that are not on the deny list, together with the remaining
    (untouched) cookie objects that are on the deny list.

        # So adding a ^ and $
        return if $name =~ qr/^${k}$/;
    }
    return 1;
}

=head2 replace_in_list

    $list2 = $mgr->replace_in_list( $list1, $cookie );

    Add $cookie to $list1, removing older occurrences in list1.
    $list1 is a list of CGI::Cookie objects.
    $cookie must be a CGI::Cookie object; if it is not, only
    cookie objects in list1 are returned (filtering list1).

    Returns an arrayref of CGI::Cookie objects.
