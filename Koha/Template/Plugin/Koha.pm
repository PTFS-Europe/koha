=head1 NAME

Koha::Template::Plugin::Koha - General Koha Template Toolkit plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin contains various Koha replated Template Toolkit functions
to help streamline Koha and to move logic from the Perl code into the
Templates when it makes sense to do so.

To use, first, include the line '[% USE Koha %]' at the top
of the template to enable the plugin.

For example: [% IF Koha.Preference( 'MyPreference ) == 'SettingA' %]
removes the necessity of setting a template variable in Perl code for
each and every system preference, even if no evaluation of the setting
is necessary.

=head2 Class Methods

=cut

sub Preference {
    my ( $self, $pref ) = @_;
    return C4::Context->preference( $pref );
}

=head3 CSVDelimiter

The delimiter option 'tabs' is stored in the DB as 'tabulation' to avoid issues
storing special characters in the DB. This helper function translates the value
to the correct character when used in templates.

You can, optionally, pass a value parameter to this routine in the case of delimiter
being fetched in the scripts and still needing to be translated

=cut

sub CSVDelimiter {
    my ( $self, $val ) = @_;
    return C4::Context->csv_delimiter($val);
}

sub Version {
    my $version_string = Koha::version();
    my ( $major, $minor, $maintenance, $development ) = split( '\.', $version_string );

    return {
        major       => $major,
        minor       => $minor,
        release     => $major . "." . $minor,
        maintenance => $major . "." . $minor . "." . $maintenance,
        development => ( $development ne '000' ) ? $development : undef,
    };
}
