=head1 NAME

C4::Suggestions - Some useful functions for dealings with aqorders.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use C4::Suggestions;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions in this module deal with the aqorders in OPAC and in librarian interface

A suggestion is done in the OPAC. It has the status "ASKED"

When a librarian manages the suggestion, they can set the status to "REJECTED" or "ACCEPTED".

When the book is ordered, the suggestion status becomes "ORDERED"

When a book is ordered and arrived in the library, the status becomes "AVAILABLE"

All aqorders of a borrower can be seen by the borrower itself.
Suggestions done by other borrowers can be seen when not "AVAILABLE"

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 SearchSuggestion

(\@array) = &SearchSuggestion($suggestionhashref_to_search)

searches for a suggestion

return :
C<\@array> : the aqorders found. Array of hash.
Note the status is stored twice :
* in the status field
* as parameter ( for example ASKED => 1, or REJECTED => 1) . This is for template & translation purposes.
