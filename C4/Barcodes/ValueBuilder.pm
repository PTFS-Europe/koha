=head1 Barcodes::ValueBuilder

This module is intended as a shim to ease the eventual transition from
having all barcode-related code in the value builder plugin .pl file
to using C4::Barcodes. Since the shift will require a rather significant
amount of refactoring, this module will return value builder-formatted
results, at first by merely running the code that was formerly in the
barcodes.pl value builder, but later by using C4::Barcodes.
